			<td><p>Visualization is a technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message.It is important to visualize the data before any calculations are carried out. The visual representation can convey much more information when compared to descriptive statistics.Data visualization is the process of creating interactive visuals to understand trends, variations, and derive meaningful insights from the data. Data visualization is used mainly for data checking and cleaning, exploration and discovery, and communicating results to business stakeholders.</p></td>

			<td><p>Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p></td>

			<td><p>Pandas-profiling generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. The pandas df.describe() function is handy yet a little basic for exploratory data analysis. Pandas-profiling extends pandas DataFrame with df.profile_report(), which automatically generates a standardized univariate and multivariate report for data understanding. It is an efficient way to digest and analyse an unfamiliar dataset by providing in-depth descriptive statistics, visual distribution graphs and a powerful set of correlation tools. </p></td>
